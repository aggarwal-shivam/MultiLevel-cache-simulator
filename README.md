## Abstract
Implements a multilevel-cache simulator for simulating the address traces generated by spec cpu files. This was implemented as an assignment in the course CS622 Advanced Computer Architecture at IIT Kanpur in Autumn Semester 2020. 
We have binary spec CPU files. We convert these binary files to text files, then we pass these addresses through our simulator.
Simulator can be used to apply any of the policies between caches, i.e, Inclusive, Exclusive or Nine.
